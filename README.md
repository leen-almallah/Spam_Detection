# Spam Detection Competition

## Description

The purpose of email spam detection is to automate the filtering process and separate unwanted or potentially harmful emails (spam) from legitimate ones, thereby improving email management and reducing the risk of security threats. Various machine learning and natural language processing techniques can be applied to analyze the textual content of emails and determine the likelihood of them being spam.

By leveraging this dataset, researchers and developers can train and evaluate different models to predict the category of incoming emails. These models can utilize various features and algorithms to learn patterns indicative of spam, such as the presence of certain keywords, patterns in sentence structure, or the use of specific formatting techniques commonly associated with spam emails.

Accurate email spam detection is crucial for ensuring a clean and secure inbox, reducing the chances of falling victim to phishing attempts, scams, malware distribution, or unwanted promotional content. The dataset provided can serve as a valuable resource for building and improving email filtering systems, enhancing user experience, and maintaining a safer digital environment.

## Covered Concepts

- **Text Analysis**
- **Clustering**
- **K-means**

## Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this competition is Precision, which is the ratio of true positives to all predicted positives. It calculates the proportion of correctly classified spam emails out of all emails predicted as spam. Precision measures the system's ability to avoid false positives, i.e., non-spam emails mistakenly classified as spam. A high precision indicates a low false-positive rate.


## Dataset Description

Email spam detection is a process of identifying and categorizing incoming emails as either spam or legitimate (non-spam) based on their content. The dataset provided for this task consists of two columns:

- **Id:** An identification number or code assigned to each email in the dataset. It is a unique identifier that distinguishes one email from another.
- **Label:** This column represents the classification label assigned to each email, indicating whether the email is categorized as spam or non-spam (legitimate).
- **Body:** This column contains the text content of the email messages, including the body of the email, subject line, and any other relevant information present in the message.

## Files

- **train.csv:** The training set.
- **test.csv:** The test set.
- **sample_submission.csv:** A sample submission file in the correct format.
